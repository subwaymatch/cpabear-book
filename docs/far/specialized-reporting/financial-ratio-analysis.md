# Financial Ratio Analysis

Ratios are typically grouped into four main categories:

1.  **Liquidity:** Measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations.
2.  **Activity (or Efficiency):** Measures how effectively a company uses its assets.
3.  **Solvency (or Leverage):** Measures a company's ability to meet its long-term obligations and its overall financial risk.
4.  **Profitability:** Measures a company's ability to generate earnings.

## Liquidity Ratios

### Current Ratio

The current ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets (current assets).

$$
\frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
$$

### Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)

The quick ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets (excluding inventory).

$$
\frac{\text{Cash} + \text{Marketable Securities} + \text{Net Accounts Receivable}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
$$

---

## Activity (Efficiency) Ratios

These ratios, often called "turnover" ratios, measure how quickly a company converts assets into cash or sales.

### Accounts Receivable Turnover

Measures how many times, on average, the company collects its receivables during a period.

$$
  \frac{\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\text{Average Net Accounts Receivable}}
$$

What it means: A higher number is better ‚Äî the company collects cash faster.

### Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)

Average number of days it takes to collect cash from a credit sale.

$$
  \frac{365\ \text{days}}{\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover}}
$$

What it means: A lower number is better.

### Inventory Turnover

How many times, on average, the company sells and replaces its inventory in a period.

$$
  \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\text{Average Inventory}}
$$

What it means: A higher number generally indicates strong sales and less risk of obsolete inventory.

### Days in Inventory

Average number of days inventory is held before being sold.

$$
  \frac{365\ \text{days}}{\text{Inventory Turnover}}
$$

What it means: A lower number is better.

## Solvency (Leverage) Ratios üèõÔ∏è

These ratios measure a company's long-term financial health and its ability to survive over a long period. They focus on debt.

### Debt-to-Assets Ratio

The percentage of the company's assets that are financed by debt.

$$
\frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Total Assets}}
$$

What it means: A lower number is less risky. For example, a ratio of 0.6 means 60% of assets are funded by creditors.

### Debt-to-Equity Ratio

Compares what the company owes (liabilities) to what it owns (equity).

$$
\frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Total Equity}}
$$

What it means: A lower number is less risky. A ratio of 1.0 means debt and equity are equal.

### Times Interest Earned (TIE) Ratio

Measures the company's ability to make its interest payments from operating profit.

$$
\frac{\text{Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)}}{\text{Interest Expense}}
$$

What it means: A higher number is safer. A TIE of 5 means operating profit can cover interest expense five times over.

---

## Profitability Ratios üìà

These ratios measure how well the company generates profit from its operations.

### Gross Profit Margin (or Gross Margin)

The percentage of each sales dollar left after paying for the goods themselves; measures basic pricing power and production efficiency.

$$
\frac{\text{Net Sales} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\text{Net Sales}}
$$

### Net Profit Margin

The percentage of each sales dollar that becomes profit after all expenses (COGS, operating, interest, and taxes) are paid.

$$
\frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Net Sales}}
$$

### Return on Assets (ROA)

Measures how efficiently management is using its assets to generate profit.

$$
\frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Average Total Assets}}
$$

What it means: A higher percentage is better.

### Return on Equity (ROE)

Measures the return generated for the company's owners (shareholders).

$$
\frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Average Total Equity}}
$$

What it means: A higher percentage is better.
