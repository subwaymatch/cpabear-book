# Cash and Receivables

## Cash and Cash Equivalents

At its most basic, cash includes all items that are _immediately_ available for use in the business and are free from any contractual restrictions.

Think of it as anything a bank would accept for deposit and immediate credit.

**Common Examples of Cash:**

- **Coins and currency** (like in a cash register or petty cash fund).
- **Demand deposits** (checking accounts, savings accounts).
- **Negotiable instruments** ready for deposit, such as:
  - Money orders
  - Cashier's checks
  - Certified checks
  - Personal checks (from customers, as long as they aren't post-dated)

### What are "Cash Equivalents"?

This is where the CPA exam likes to test the rules. **Cash equivalents** are short-term, highly liquid investments that are:

1.  Readily convertible to a known amount of cash.
2.  So near their maturity that they present an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate fluctuations.

#### The "Three-Month" Rule ðŸŽ¯

Here is the most important rule you must memorize:

> To be a cash equivalent, an investment must have an **original maturity of three months or less _from the date of purchase_**.

This "date of purchase" part is critical.

- **Example (IS a cash equivalent):** On December 1, 20X1, your company buys a $10,000 U.S. Treasury bill that was issued on August 1, 20X1, and matures on February 1, 20X2.
  - **Maturity from _your purchase date_:** Dec 1 to Feb 1 is **two months**.
  - **Conclusion:** This **IS** a cash equivalent.
- **Example (is NOT a cash equivalent):** On March 1, 20X1, your company buys a $50,000 U.S. Treasury note that matures on August 1, 20X1. - **Maturity from _your purchase date_:** March 1 to Aug 1 is **five months**. - **Conclusion:** This is **NOT** a cash equivalent. It would be classified as a short-term investment (e.g., trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity).
  **Common Examples of Cash Equivalents:**

- **U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills)** purchased with 3 months or less to maturity.
- **Money market funds** (which are generally considered "on demand").
- **Commercial paper** (a form of short-term corporate debt) if its original maturity is 3 months or less.
- **Certificates of Deposit (CDs)** with a maturity of 3 months or less.

### What is _NOT_ Cash or Cash Equivalents?

The FAR exam will try to trick you with items that sound like cash but aren't.

| **Item**                               | **Why It's Excluded**                                                                                                                                  | **How It's Classified**                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Restricted Cash**                    | It is not "free from restriction." It's set aside for a specific purpose (e.g., as collateral for a loan, or to be used for a future plant expansion). | Reported as a separate line item. It can be **current** or **non-current** depending on _when_ the restriction will be lifted.                                                |
| **Compensating Balances**              | A minimum balance required to be kept in a bank account to support a loan. This portion is not available for general use.                              | Reported as "restricted cash" (current or non-current) if the restriction is legally binding.                                                                                 |
| **Bank Overdrafts**                    | A negative cash balance in a checking account.                                                                                                         | Generally reported as a **current liability**. _Exception:_ If you have multiple accounts at the _same bank_, GAAP allows you to offset an overdraft with a positive balance. |
| **Post-Dated Checks (from customers)** | You cannot deposit it _today_.                                                                                                                         | **Accounts Receivable**.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **NSF Checks (from customers)**        | "Non-sufficient funds." The check bounced; it's not cash.                                                                                              | **Accounts Receivable** (you have to go back and collect it).                                                                                                                 |
| **IOUs (from employees)**              | This is a receivable, not cash.                                                                                                                        | **Receivable from Employee**.                                                                                                                                                 |
