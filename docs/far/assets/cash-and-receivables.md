# Cash and Receivables

ðŸª™ **1\. Cash and Cash Equivalents**

### Definition

**Cash** includes:

- Currency and coins on hand
- Demand deposits (checking and savings accounts)
- Deposits that can be withdrawn without restriction or penalty
  - Checking accounts
  - Savings accounts
- Money market funds
- Certificates of deposit (CDs) with maturities â‰¤ 90 days

:::info[Check the original maturity date]

A certificate of deposit (CD) is considered a cash equivalent only if its original maturity date is 90 days or less from the date of purchase.

For example, a 4-month CD purchased on November 1, Year that matures on February 28, Year 2 is **not** a cash equivalent on the balance sheet date of December 31, Year 1 because its original maturity date exceeds 90 days.

**Cash equivalents** include **short-term, highly liquid investments** that are:

- Readily convertible to known amounts of cash
- So near their maturity (â‰¤ 90 days from purchase) that they present **insignificant risk of value change**

### Common Examples

Savings accounts and money market funds

Commercial paper, Treasury bills, and CDs (â‰¤ 90 days maturity)
